 # Interactive Road Accidents Data Visualization Dashboard using Tableau

## Project Description:
1. Utilized Kaggle's road accidents dataset to develop an interactive and user-friendly data visualization dashboard using Tableau.
2. Designed and implemented key performance indicators (KPIs) to track critical metrics such as total accidents, fatal casualties, and 
   serious casualties.
3. Incorporated sparkline graphs to enable year-over-year comparisons for each KPI.
4. Created dynamic donut charts to analyze casualties by different weather conditions and road conditions, with parameter and filter 
   functionality for user customization.
5. Developed a bar chart to visualize the distribution of accidents by road type.
6. Implemented an interactive map that allows users to explore different casualty categories geographically.


## Tools Used:
1. Tableau
2. Excel (for data preprocessing)


## Achievements:
1. Successfully transformed complex road accidents data into an intuitive and interactive visualization dashboard.
2. Improved accessibility to accident data and provided actionable insights for safety and policy planning.
3. Demonstrated proficiency in data visualization, Tableau, and data analysis.
4. Enhanced understanding of the factors contributing to road accidents and casualties.
5. Gained expertise in data preprocessing, transformation, and visualization.
6. Strengthened skills in designing interactive and user-centric Tableau dashboards.
