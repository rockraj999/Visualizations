# IPL Data Analysis and Visualization using Power BI


## Project Description:
1. Conducted in-depth analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data spanning from 2008 to 2022 from Kaggle.
2. Designed and developed a user-friendly, interactive dashboard using Power BI to extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
3. Created a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track critical metrics including season-winning teams, top run-scorers (Orange 
   Cap), top wicket-takers (Purple Cap), and tournament-wide statistics like total sixes and fours.
4. Developed custom IPL batting and bowling statistics features which allow users to explore player-specific data such as total runs, total 
   sixes, total fours, strike rates, total wickets, economy rates, bowling averages, and bowling strike rates.
5. Designed data visualizations, including donut charts to visualize match outcomes based on toss decisions, match results, bar graphs to 
   display match wins by venue, and team-specific bar graphs to showcase total wins by season.
6. Utilized user input functionality to allow users to filter and customize their data exploration experience, enhanced dashboard 
   interactivity.
7. The project demonstrates proficiency in Power BI for data visualization, data transformation, and the creation of interactive dashboards.
